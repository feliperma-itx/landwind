## Wedding RyM Tailwind CSS Landing Page

## Getting started

Make sure that you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/), [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation) and [Flowbite](https://flowbite.com/docs/getting-started/quickstart/) installed.

1. Run `npm install` inside your ter<minal

2. Watch for files and compile Tailwind CSS + Flowbite:

```
npx tailwindcss -i ./input.css -o ./output.min.css --watch
```

3. To deploy you will only need the `index.html` file and the `output.min.css` styles.

Alternatively, you can also just directly copy this code into your own projects, whether you use Laravel, React, Vue.js or other frameworks.

4. You can use Netlify (or others) and execute the following command: `npx tailwindcss -i ./input.css -o ./output.min.css --minify`
